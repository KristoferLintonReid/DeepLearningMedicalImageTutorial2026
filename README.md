## How to Use This Repository

1. **Run the notebooks in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)**.
2. **Change your runtime to use a GPU**:
   - Go to the top menu in Colab ➔ **Runtime** ➔ **Change runtime type** ➔ Select **GPU**.
3. **Follow the order of the notebooks**:

| Order | Notebook | Description |
|:-----:|:---------|:------------|
| 1 | [Data_exploration.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/KristoferLintonReid/DeepLearningMedicalImageTutorial2026/blob/main/Data_exploration.ipynb) | **Start Here**: Explore the PathMNIST dataset, visualize medical images, and understand data preprocessing requirements. |
| 2 | [Building_Models.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/KristoferLintonReid/DeepLearningMedicalImageTutorial2026/blob/main/Building_Models.ipynb) | **Core Learning**: Implement and compare three key strategies: Radiomics, SimpleCNN, and Contrastive Learning. |

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this exercise, you will be able to:

- **Compare and select** appropriate deep learning strategies (Radiomics, SimpleCNN, Contrastive models) based on the problem and dataset characteristics.
- **Design and implement** a model architecture tailored for medical image analysis.
- **Understand the importance** of key hyperparameters and optimization strategies.
- **Critically assess** model strengths and limitations in a medical context.
- **Interpret evaluation metrics** and explain which ones are most relevant for medical imaging tasks.
- **Differentiate** between radiomics-based methods, end-to-end deep learning models, and contrastive learning approaches.
- **Identify challenges** related to deep learning with small datasets and medical imaging specifics.
